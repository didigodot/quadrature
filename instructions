Instructions:

1) Go to the directory quadrature/quadrature/
2) Run "Driver" by either typing "java Driver" or opening Driver.java in jGrasp
3) Experiment with different integration domains, step sizes, 
   and quadrature rules. The program will give you answers to 
   the integration problem of your choice. Try using the program for
   different power functions using the drop-down menu.

The APIs are available at the directory quadrature/quadrature/.
Stubs used for planning the project are available at quadrature/stubs/.
