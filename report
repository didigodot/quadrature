Project Report - Didi Park

    In this project, I (as an individual not part of a team) created 
a program to calculate integrals for three simple power functions 
using three different methods of numerical integration. The user can 
alter the step size of the integration method,the integration domain, 
and the function using a graphical user interface.
    Four classes were involved in the program. A Driver, a Panel, a Display,
and a Processor. The Driver functioned to put a JFrame on the screen at a 
certain location and size. The Panel served to draw different subpanels on
the JFrame. I chose to use a BorderLayout on the Panel, with a Display in
the center, a title subpanel in the north, and a subpanel on the east containing
user input components. The Panel processed user input and sent this information
to the Display and the Processor. The Display drew the function and visualizations
of the integration methods on the screen. The Processor computed the answers
to integration problems; its information was used by the Panel to display
these answer to the user. 
    I learned how to integrate different graphical components, such as JPanels,
JFrames, and PaintComponents into one GUI; this was challenging because it 
required me to research deeper into the workings of java GUIs. I also learned
more about different layout managers as I decided which ones to use. In addition
to this, I reinforced my knowledge on how to call methods from other classes 
and how to modify variables from other classes. Without this project, I would
not know how to integrate so many different parts into one cohesive program.
